# Acquisition-Merger-Analysis-Hadoop-HDFS-Hive-Zeppelin-Spark-SQL-Scala-Python-SQLAlchemy-Tableau-Power BI

## Overview:

Investigating and identifying various organizations for the most profitable merger and acquisition by examining accumulated data sets.

In this project, I will showcase how to input the dataset into the Hadoop's Cloud Enviroment and MySQL Database's Virtual Environment to conduct analysis in SQL, Python, Scala, Tableau and Power BI. The analysis level can be upgraded level to dive deeper into insights generated by SQL and Tableau or Power BI.

## Platforms, Languages and Tools:

- Big Data's Environment: Hadoop, HDFS, Zeppelin, Spark, Scala, SQL

or

- MySQL Database's Virtual Environment: MySQL, SQL, Python, SQL Alchemy

or

- Cloud-based service: Azure

and

- Tableau

- Power BI

## Dataset:

The dataset is pretty simple with 3 different CSV files. That means I will create 3 different respective tables in Hadoop and MySQL.

Firm.csv

| Firm_ID | Firm_Name |
|-|-|

Staff.csv

| Emp_ID | Name | Prefix | First_Name | Middle_Initial | Last_Name | Gender | E_Mail | Father_Name | Mother_Name | Mother_Maiden_Name | Date_of_Birth | Time_of_Birth | Age_in_Yrs | Weight_in_Kgs | Date_of_Joining | Quarter_of_Joining | Half_of_Joining | Year_of_Joining | Month_of_Joining | Month_Name_of_Joining | Short_Month | Day_of_Joining | DOW_of_Joining | Short_DOW | Age_in_Company_Years | Salary | SSN | Phone_No | Place_Name | County | City | State | Zip | Region | User_Name | Password | Firm_ID | 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

Sales.csv

| Order_Number | Quantity_Ordered | Price_of_Each_Order | Line_Number | Sales | Revenue | Order_Date | Status | Quarter_ID | Month_ID | Year_ID | Product_Line | MSRP | Product_Code | Customer_Name | Phone | Address_Line 1 | Address_Line 2 | City | State | Postal_Code | Country | Territory | Contact_Last_Name | Contact_First_Name | Deal_Size | Firm_ID | 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

## Input data:

### Big Data's Cloud Platform - Hadoop:

#### 1. Load data into HDFS

- Upload the Firm CSV file to a folder named 'tmp' and the Sales & Staff Csv files to a sub-folder in it

![File storage 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/139749698-7351df77-5f7b-4661-829a-1cd90cf5959d.png)

#### 2. Create an external tables in Hive for 'Firm' CSV file:
```
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Company (
		CompanyID INT, Name STRING)
		COMMENT 'Date of company names'
		ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
		FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
		STORED AS TEXTFILE
```

![Hive table 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70437668/139749686-5e87c061-a40a-4900-9261-4a7b159116f2.png)

#### 3. Load data of 2 CSV files into Zeppelin:

Create a sub-folder in the main folder 'tmp' to store the remaining 2 CSV files

##### 3.a. Sales:

```
%spark2
val Sales = (spark.read
		.option("header", "true") // Use first line as header
		.option("inferSchema", "true") // Infer Schema
		.csv("/tmp/Sales and Staff/Sales.csv")
```

##### 3.b. Sales:
```
%spark2
val Staff = (spark.read
		.option("header", "true") // Use first line as header
		.option("inferSchema", "true") // Infer Schema
		.csv("/tmp/Sales and Staff/Staff.csv")
```

#### 4. Print Scheme:
```
%spark2
sales.printSchema()
```

```
%spark2
employee.printSchema()
```

#### 5. Print out the data:
```
%spark2.sql
SELECT *
FROM EmpView
```

```
 %spark2.sql
SELECT *
FROM SalesView
```

#### 5. Analysis on Zeppelin:

##### 5.1. Revenue by Product Line:
```
SELECT Product_Line, Sum(Revenue) as Cumulated_Revenue 
FROM SalesView
GROUP BY Product_Line
```

##### 5.2. Sum Sales by Product Line & Firm Name
```
%spark2.sql
SELECT SUM(SalesView.Sales), SalesView.Product_Line, Firm.Firm_Name
FROM SalesView
JOIN Firm 
ON Firm.Firm_ID = SalesView.Firm_ID
WHERE Firm.Firm_ID < 11
GROUP BY SalesView.Product_Line
```

#### 5.3 Sum Revenue by Firm Name categorized by Car
```
%spark2.sql
SELECT SUM(SalesView.Revenue), Firm.Firm_Name 
FROM SalesView, Firm 
WHERE SalesView.Firm_ID = Firm.Firm_ID 
AND SalesView.Product_Line LIKE "%Cars%" 
GROUP BY Firm.Firm_Name  
ORDER BY SUM(SalesView.Sales) DESC
```

#### 5.4 Percentage of Salary to Revenue for each Firm by name
```
%spark2.sql
SELECT  SUM(SV.Revenue), SUM(EV.Salary), SUM(EV.Salary) / SUM(SV.Revenue)  * 100 AS Percent, F.Firm_Name 
FROM Salesview SV, Firm F, EmpView EV
WHERE SV.Firm_ID = EC.Firm_ID 
AND F.Firm_ID = EV.Firm_ID  
GROUP BY F.Firm_Name
ORDER BY Percent DESC

```

#### 5.5 Demonstrate employee's name, their salary in the British Leyland firm only with ascending salary's order

```
%spark2.sql
SELECT EV.Salary, EV.First_Name, EV.Last_Name, F.Firm_name  
FROM Firm F, EmpView EV
WHERE F.Firm_ID = EV.Firm_ID 
AND F.Firm_Name = "British Leyland"  
ORDER BY EV.Salary DESC

```

### MySQL Database:

#### 1. Create 3 tables for Firm, Sales, Staff: 

After designing tables in MySQL Database (TablePlus app) in SQL (as below queries) or manually by predefined functions in this app, I can insert the CSV files by import function or writing SQLAlchemy coding lines to import files from Jupyter's Virtual Environment. The below images illustrate how they are inserted directly from files. The next section will show how insert from Jupyter in Python.

##### 1.1 Firm: 
```
CREATE TABLE `firm` (
  `Firm_ID` int(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `Firm_Name` varchar(50) CHARACTER SET utf8 NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`Firm_ID`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=16 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf16 COLLATE=utf16_general_ci
```

# Mapping classes with tables in TablePlus's databases

#Session = sessionmaker()

session = Session() # object
#Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

##### 2.2.4 Insert all rows of each dataframe to database's tables in TablePlus's MySQL Database

New Method: inserting directly from data frames

Inserting takes long time means that selecting or filtering will take less time, and in reverse, due to adding IDX for a column or different columns depending on purposes of saving data into relational database only or reading the data.

I will insert dataframes in batches into session (relational database), then commit to finalize saving. If an error happen, that batch will be stopped inserting and still stay in the session and other batches will not be entered into the session as well if flush() is placed outside 'for loop'. Therefore, if flush() is placed inside the for loop, batches will be flushed into the session regarless any error might occur. But we have to set rollback() in the except case to delete any existing batches in the session causing an error.

###### 2.2.4.2 Insert 'df_Sales' dataframe into 'sales' table in the MySQL database

NaN values appeared in the column State because many countries don't have states like the US so I had replaced them to 'None'.

nan values appeared in the column Territory because of 'NA' standing for 'North America' so I had replaced it with 'N.A'.

Both the Sales and Staff tables didn't have their own ID columns so I had to created one for each as the Primary Key. However, there were some rows in Sales were collapsed. Then I went to Data > Ungroup > Clear Outline to expand all collapsed rows. After that, I fill auto-increment values for ID column by rename the ID column by ROW() for cell A1. Cell A2 will be =ROW(A1) and I copied A2's formula for the rest of cells to get all ID rows filled with unique numbers.

I had set up the DateTime typed columns in both files by timestamp in the MySQL Database. However, there was a problem with doing so although this method is correct with other datasets with the same value. Then I had to change all timestamp type in MySQL into varchar and DateTime(timezone=True)) in SQLAlchemy into String().

## Visualization

### Total Sales by Product Line

Classic cars play the most significant role in contributing to the Total Sales by Product Line reaching nearly $4.0 million. The 2nd ranked selling product is Vintage Cars, roughly half of the Sales generated by Classic Cars. Motorcycles are slightly above half of the sales driven by Vintage Cars, which is about the same as the Trucks and Buses. However, Planes are not among the Top 3 sold Products with sales close up to $1.0 million. Ships are also 1 major transporter but provided approximately $715K of Sales. Meanwhile, Trains are the lowest sold product among all transporters. 

To dive deeper into this figure, a visualized chart of Sales run by all countries can be demonstrated to see which countries have the same or different trend as this general case. I can guess before doing that chart that the US will have the same trend with cars are top transporters and trains are not heavily invested throughout the country. Other countries can be seen in that chart later.

### Total Sales by Firm Name colored by Product Line

This chart shows that Humber Tech and Modi Enterprises deliver the most sales of Classic Cars above $300K. But in the sales of classic cars, Gregory Issacs leads this market with over $150K and it is followed by the 2nd player, Modi. Meanwhile, Humber Tech doesn't have strong sales in this sector like the other two.

Motorcycles saw a quite noteworthy fluctuation among all firms. Pele Rivelleno Inc is ahead of competitors with sales of over $100K. However, British Leyland undergoes to follow Pele's position very closely.

The real forefront of the Plane sector is Blackwell with Sales over $100K. Rolls Royce is also a manufacture of the plane engine, however, doesn't experience great sales, but the lowest one.

Regarding Trains, the sales fluctuate mildly around $10-20K in all firms.

### Total Sales by Firm Name and Product Line

All in all, all firms perform best in classic cars. They do invest in manufacturing and selling all products. But, one catchy note is that they generate sales differently for the rest of the product line. The chart below breaks down how each firm operates its sales orientation.

### Total Revenue by Firm Name

Modi earned the highest revenue with over $737 million. Blackwell ranked 2nd with $734 million although it is not the Top 3 players in the Top 3 products. However, because of its high sales combined from all these 3 products: classic & vintage cars and motorcycles, Blackwell earned the 2nd title in Profit.

### Revenue Distribution by Product Line

There is a strong correlation between Sales and Revenue distributed by Product lines. Classic, Vintage Cars, and Motorcycles result in the Top 3 of both metrics.

### Radar Chart Sum Sales by Product Line & Firm Name

This Radar chart can also sketch the significant difference in sales between product lines. Classic cars show beyond doubt the highest sales of all products with Humber Tech as the champion. Other sector shows the same correlation as mentioned above that Vintage Cars rank 2nd and Motorcycles rank 3rd as the radar leans towards the left-hand side crucially.

It can be drawn on Tableau manually by following this tutorial's steps. These steps are pretty long to prepare in advance. However, it makes data visualization even more advanced in terms of complexity and explainability: [Drawing Radar Charts in Tableau](https://tableau.toanhoang.com/drawing-radar-charts-in-tableau/)

These last Radar charts were scaled at first so they don't show the sales amount but the distribution of sales from firms by sector.  For example, Modi led first in the sectors of Classic Cars, Trucks and Buses, and Planes, but not the Ships
